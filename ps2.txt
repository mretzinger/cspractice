Problem 1

n = 6a + 9b + 20c
50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55

50 = 6(2) + 9(2) + 20(1)
51 = 6(1) + 9(5) + 20(0)
52 = 6(2) + 9(0) + 20(2)
53 = 6(4) + 9(1) + 20(1)
54 = 60(0) + 9(6) + 20(0)
55 = 6(1) + 9(1) + 20(2)

56 = 50 + 6
57 = 51 + 6
58 = 52 + 6
59 = 53 + 6
60 = 54 + 6
61 = 55 + 6

62 = 56 + 6
63 = 57 + 6
64 = 58 + 6
65 = 59 + 6


Problem 2
Theorem: If it is possible to buy x, x+1,â€¦, x+5 sets of McNuggets, for some x, then it is
possible to buy any number of McNuggets >= x, given that McNuggets come in 6, 9 and 20
packs.
